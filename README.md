# Work-Day-Planner



## Description
This is where I use my knowledge in HTML, CSS javascript/jQuery to build this Work Day Planner. I am using daily planner to create a shedule by the hour, which will help you keep track of your day.  Fill in your time block, give it a name and save it to view your day.

## Function
The Work Day Planner starts to function with the current day displayed at the top of the calendar. When you scroll down you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When you click a timeblock you can enter in an event.  Click save for that timeblock and see it in your calendar. 


## Credits
* [Credits]
I would like to give credit to my Varsity Tutor for helping me understand how to use javascript and jQuery.  I have learned so much on this assignment. Really taking the time to explain how to read and understand the acceptance criteria to generate code and using google.

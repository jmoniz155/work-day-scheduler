# Work-Day-Planner



## Description
This is where I use my knowledge in HTML, CSS javascript/jQuery to build this Work Day Planner. I am using daily planner to create a shedule by the hour, which will help you keep track of your day.  Fill in your time block, give it a name and save it to view your day.

## Function
The Work Day Planner starts to function with the current day displayed at the top of the calendar. When you scroll down you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When you click a timeblock you can enter in an event.  Click save for that timeblock and see it in your calendar.
